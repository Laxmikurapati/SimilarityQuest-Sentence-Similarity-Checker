## Introduction

Welcome to QuoraQuest, where we embark on an exciting journey to explore the hidden connections among questions on Quora. Our mission is to unveil the intertwined threads of similarity and make knowledge discovery a breeze for every user.

## The Search for Harmony

Imagine a grand symphony of knowledge, where each question resonates with its kindred counterparts, creating a harmonious tapestry of curiosity. Quora, a vast ocean of questions, offers boundless opportunities to uncover these connections. Join us as we set sail on QuoraQuest, unraveling the secrets that unite inquisitive minds.

## From Raw to Refined

Our quest begins with the enchantment of Data Transformation. We cleanse and refine the raw question data, turning it into valuable nuggets of information. The essence of questions is revealed as we prepare them for the magical world of Feature Engineering.

## Crafting Magical Features

In the realm of Feature Engineering, we wield our craft to create powerful tools for question similarity. Starting with the basic Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach, we unlock greater wonders with each enchantment:

1. **Bag-of-Words (BoW) - Enchanted (Accuracy: 0.7873125)**: The foundational spell that boosts accuracy and lays the groundwork for our quest.

2. **Bi-gram of Words (Accuracy: 0.791625)**: Word pairs dance in harmony, providing a deeper understanding of context and lifting accuracy to new heights.

3. **Tri-gram of Words (Accuracy: 0.787125)**: The trinity of words contributes to the enchantment, although bi-grams remain the star of the show.

4. **TF-IDF Vectorizer (Accuracy: 0.7900625)**: The arcane power of TF-IDF measures word significance and provides valuable insights.

5. **Word2Vec - Method 1 (Accuracy: 0.7676875)**: Word embeddings promise semantic understanding, though the full power is yet to be unleashed.

6. **Word2Vec - Method 2 (Accuracy: 0.8098125)**: The peak of our magic! Word2Vec shines with semantic understanding, reigning supreme among the models.

7. **BERT (Accuracy: 0.74375)**: BERT, a mighty language model, shows its valor, but Word2Vec claims the throne.

## Unleashing QuoraQuest Power

Armed with the mightiest of question similarity models, QuoraQuest reveals its power upon the vast Quora ocean. Users can now navigate a celestial network of related questions, guided by the stars of similarity, finding wisdom and camaraderie in the community.

## Pledging to Explore Further

Our quest doesn't end here! We pledge to continue refining our models, seeking greater heights of accuracy and understanding. Your feedback and contributions fuel our journey to create a QuoraQuest beyond imagination.
